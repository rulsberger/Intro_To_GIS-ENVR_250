    "### General Information \n",
    "Geographic Information Systems (GIS) comprises a complex system of tools that facilitate the collection, display, and analysis of geospatial (location-based) data. A GIS is effective in supporting work across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.  Specific applications include environmental sciences, public health, urban planning, conservation biology, geology, digital humanities, military, and education and continues to increase as technology advances. This course is designed for students who have little or no experience with GIS and want to gain an understanding of the technology.  In this course, students gain a deeper understanding of the core concepts of the field and learn how to apply them in specialized areas of study.  This course will use ArcGIS Pro software and include an introduction to ArcGIS Online tools to support project-based exercises in a hands-on lab environment.  No previous experience with GIS is required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After Completing this course, students should:  \n",
    "1. Understand basic theoretical concepts of GIS and spatial analysis  \n",
    "2. Be equipped to formulate a research question and lay out and implement analytical steps required in GIS  \n",
    "3. Know how to find and use various spatial data to research a topic  \n",
    "4. Be equipped to create maps following fundamental cartographic principles  \n",

    "### Course Logistics \n",
    "**GitHub:**   \n",
    "All lectures class materials are hosted on this course [Github Repository](https://github.com/rulsberger/Intro_To_GIS-ENVR_250) on my Github [(rulsberger)](https://github.com/rulsberger/). This allows me to manage versions and publish changes to lectures, assignments, and files while enabling you to see the changes publicly as well as after our classes. Bookmark and read it whenever you need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Canvas:**  \n",
    "Additionally, this course will rely heavy on communication through Canvas. Course readings, lecture slides urls, and supplemental resources will all be posted on Canvas. Additionally, Canvas submissions will be used for all homework and reading discussions. Each unit of this course (see syllabus below) will have a dedicated introductory page on Canvas with key resources, expectations, and goals for unit. Lastly, I will re-post this syllabus if modifications are required and will alert students via email that an adjusted syllabus has been uploaded.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Computer Lab Availability:**  \n",
    "Homework assignments and final projects in this course will require extensive use of GIS software outside of class. This lab (Thompson 189) should be available for your use 24/7, aside from other regularly scheduled classes (see schedule on the back wall). Always remember to be respectful of others when using this space. This lab serves students in many classes in addition to ours. Please let me know if any issues arise regarding access or use of this lab space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Storage:**  \n",
    "While some data can be stored on local machines in the lab, I highly suggest a small USB flash drive or other external hard drive device for use in this course (16 GB *should* be sufficient, depending on your final project topic). Data organization and integrity is key for successful GIS projects. You will save many hours of work by keeping your data well organized and relatively portable (i.e. on an external drive).  \n",
    "\n",
    "At least one student loses their work each semester. I highly suggest backing up your work in more than one place (hard storage and the cloud) and remember to SAVE SAVE SAVE. You will also want to version your work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Assessment:**  \n",
    "Students will be assessed based on periodic homework assignments, online discussion responses, six lab assignments, a midterm, and a final project. To receive a grade, all homework MUST be submitted on Canvas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your final grade will be derived as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "| **Assignment** | **Total Points** | **Percent of Grade** |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Labs** | **300** | **30%** |\n",
    "| Lab 1  | 50 |  |\n",
    "| Lab 2 | 50 |  |\n",
    "| Lab 3 | 50 |  |\n",
    "| Lab 4 | 50 |  |\n",
    "| Lab 5 | 50 |  |\n",
    "| Lab 6 | 50 |  |\n",
    "| **Midterm** | **150** | **15%** |\n",
    "| **Final Project** | **400** | **40%** |\n",
    "| Peer Evaluation | 50 |  |\n",
    "| Lightning Talk | 50 |  |\n",
    "| Final Paper | 100 |  |\n",
    "| Final Map | 100 |  |\n",

    "| **Total** | **1000** | **100%**|\n",
    " \n",
    "**Late Assignments:**  \n",
    "Late assignments will be accepted for two weeks after the due date. All late work will have 10 points deducted from the final assessment grade. An additional 10 points will be deducted after one week (for a maximum 20-point deduction for a 2-week late assignment). There will be no make-up quizzes or exams.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a valid, documented reason for not meeting a deadline, let me know before the deadline.  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Working with Other Students:**  \n",
    "Students are encouraged to work together on lab and other assignments to assist each other in understanding the exercises and software. However, ALL content of each student’s handed in assignment (text, graphics, etc.) must be authored solely by that student. \n",
    "Do not hand in identical figures, graphs, text answers, or other information. These work will be considered plagiarized.  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Active Participation:**  \n",
    "A portion of your final grade will be derived from attendance and active participation in class. Often, we will have in-class group and individual exercises to get comfortable with GIS software and spatial analysis concepts. These in-class assignments will not be graded – they are opportunities to collaborate with both your peers and instructor – but turning in these assignments will count towards your participation grade. If you are not in class, you have no way to participate in these exercises and will lose out on this learning opportunity.  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Final Project:**  \n",
    "Each student will be responsible for a final project accounting for 40% of their total grade. Most of the learning for this project will be self-guided, and as such, it is important not to slack or procrastinate on this project. The project will comprise of four different pieces:  \n",
    "1. A ‘Lightning Talk’ conducted during the last two weeks of class.    \n",
    "2. The final project itself (the software files, process, execution)  \n",
    "3. A final map presenting your results   \n",
    "4. A final paper explaining your research questions, methods, and summarizing your results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go into the details about each of these sections more in Week 5.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Classroom Emergency Response Guidance:**\n",
    "Please review university emergency preparedness, response procedures and a training video posted at www.pugetsound.edu/emergency/. There is a link on the university home page. Familiarize yourself with hall exit doors and the designated gathering area for your class and laboratory buildings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If building evacuation becomes necessary (e.g. earthquake), meet your instructor at the designated gathering area so she/he can account for your presence. Then wait for further instructions. Do not return to the building or classroom until advised by a university emergency response representative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If confronted by an act of violence, be prepared to make quick decisions to protect your safety. Flee the area by running away from the source of danger if you can safely do so. If this is not possible, shelter in place by securing classroom or lab doors and windows, closing blinds, and turning off room lights. Lie on the floor out of sight and away from windows and doors. Place cell phones or pagers on vibrate so that you can receive messages quietly. Wait for further instruction.  \n",
