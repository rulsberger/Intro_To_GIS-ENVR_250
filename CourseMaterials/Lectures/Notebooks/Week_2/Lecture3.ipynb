Each represents a property that can be measured at any location.\n",

This is a binary scalar where a value of 0 is assigned to a location devoid of buildings and a value of 1 is assigned to locations having one or more buildings. A field representation of buildings may not seem intuitive, in fact, given the definition of an object view of the world in the last section, it would seem only fitting to view buildings as objects. In fact, buildings can be viewed as both field or objects. The context of the analysis is ultimately what will dictate which view to adopt. If we’re interested in studying the distribution of buildings over a study area, then an object view of the features makes sense. If, on the other hand, we are interested in identifying all locations where buildings don’t exist, then a binary field view of these entities would make sense.\n",
