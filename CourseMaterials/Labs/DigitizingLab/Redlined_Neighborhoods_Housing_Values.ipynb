    "      1) We have a many to one relationship of building records, to parcel records currently. Lets go back to working with parcels. To do so we are going to use the Analysis -> Disvolve tool. The Disolve tool combines geometries and summarizes selected attributes using varioues statisical methods. In this case, our buildings are actually being represented by the same geometry, a parcel boundary. So our dissolve feature returns the same geometry. In other analyses we can combine different features of similar types, making larger polygons, or even multipart polygons. \n",
