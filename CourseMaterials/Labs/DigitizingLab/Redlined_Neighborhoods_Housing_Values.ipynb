    "For our next couple weeks of work, we are going to be exploring relationships between different datasets and the Residential Security Maps created by the Home Owners Land Corporation (HOLC). These security grades were used by lenders to vet applicants trying to buy, or refinance their homes. Most often factors influencing the grade of the neighborhood included presence of persons of color, affluence of neighbors, and also other environmental characteristics. This action was called Redlining.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the consequences of these neighborhoods was the less access to wealth. Redlining stopped the investment into infrastructure into neighborhoods, and as such, deteriorated builds, outdated building materials. As such, we can hypothesis that redlining caused home values to not appreciate as much as other neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's see what our data says! \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the best way to think about this question is by looking at the change in assessed values over time. However, for data and simplicity of this analysis, let's see if there are still any relationship between current assessed values for single family houses and historic redlines neighborhoods. \n",
