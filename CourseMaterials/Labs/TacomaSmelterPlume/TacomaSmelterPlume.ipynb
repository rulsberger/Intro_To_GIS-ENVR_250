    "Before Point Ruston Developments, the ASARCO Smelting Facility dominated the Tacoma Waterfront and operated from 1888 to 1985. If you want to read some more history, give it a read [here.](https://www.historylink.org/File/8744) \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, this industry operated at the same time that these maps were drawn and may have been the industry where the 'working class' actually worked here in Tacoma. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Smelter was very bad and the fallout from the smelting processes caused contamination throughout Pierce, King, and Kitsap County. \n",

    "## Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we are going to use this lab to start identifying how to work with <em>Raster Data</em>. For data like our smelter plume, we often sample data at discrete locations, but the data is actually a continuous surface. In this case, we have pollution of Arsenic and Lead as fallout from a single point source. It has been deposited these contaminents in different degrees based on the prevailing wind currents in the Puget Sound Area for years, so if we viewed this data it would look like a contamination surface.
