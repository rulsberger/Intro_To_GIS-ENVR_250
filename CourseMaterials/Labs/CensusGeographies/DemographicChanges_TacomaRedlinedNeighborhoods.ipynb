    "During our Lab 1 exercise, we tested to see if the spatial distribution of assessed values per square foot in Tacoma had any correlation with the neighborhoods create in 1937 by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC). Given what we watched in the overview video from NPR, I hope that you found it interesting that we did not find any strong connection between HOLC grades and home value. So this begs the question, what could have changed here?\n",

    "This lab we plan on looking at demographic changes in Tacoma to see how populations have shifted over the last 20 years. To do this, we will be using information from the US Census to track population and race across the Decennial Census in 2000, 2010, and 2020. \n",

    "Our analysis will be very similar to the structure of Lab 1. We are going to assign our blocks to the associated HOLC Neighborhood spatially, aggregate the data, and calculate statistics to let us compare Neighborhood to Neighborhood. However, the point of this exercise is to show you alternatives to using operations like a spatial join, and use geographic operations with more fine control. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first, is that we are going to use a distance calculation a given block and neighborhood based in the center of a block called the Centroid. Secondly, we are going to use a geometric operation called Union to merge the boundaries of a block and the neighborhoods, and calculate the percentage that a block overlaps with a given neighborhood.\n",

    "Completing these joins, we will calculate the demographic changes between decennial census' to see if there is any correlation with the HOLC neighborhood grades. Our data will be joined to the blocks based on the geoid for the corresponding year, and we will aggregate the data to the respective neighborhoods.\n",

Rather they are a cohesive 'fabric' which makes up an entire County. If you think about a parcel, if you needed to redraw the property, you are redrawing the neighboring parcels boundary too.
